# Blendguard Guide+

Simple mod editing the in-game UI of [Blendguard](https://romanleco.itch.io/blendguard) to make it more useful for intermediate & higher level players.
It supports stat changes from other mods like **my** other mods and would fully work with mods that add more Guide entries.

It also displays non-vanilla info like DPS and warnings for some towers.

---

### Roadmap
- first and foremost I want to add some polish this mod it's not buggy, but it's lacking,
- BEFORE the blendguard update I intend to update this mod with an API for adding custom stat entries
- and POST blendguard update I will make sure the mod supports ASAP.
